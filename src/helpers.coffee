# This file contains the common helper functions that we'd like to share among
# the **Lexer**, **Rewriter**, and the **Nodes**. Merge objects, flatten
# arrays, count characters, that sort of thing.

# Peek at the beginning of a given string to see if it matches a sequence.
exports.starts = (string, literal, start) ->
  literal is string.substr start, literal.length

# Peek at the end of a given string to see if it matches a sequence.
exports.ends = (string, literal, back) ->
  len = literal.length
  literal is string.substr string.length - len - (back or 0), len

# Trim out all falsy values from an array.
exports.compact = (array) ->
  item for item in array when item

# Count the number of occurences of a character in a string.
exports.count = (string, letter) ->
  num = pos = 0
  num++ while pos = 1 + string.indexOf letter, pos
  num

# Return a flattened version of an array.
# Handy for getting a list of `children` from the nodes.
exports.flatten = flatten = (array) ->
  flattened = []
  for element in array
    if element instanceof Array
      flattened = flattened.concat flatten element
    else
      flattened.push element
  flattened

# Delete a key from an object, returning the value. Useful when a node is
# looking for a particular method in an options hash.
exports.del = (obj, key) ->
  val =  obj[key]
  delete obj[key]
  val

# Gets the last item of an array(-like) object.
exports.last = (array, back) -> array[array.length - (back or 0) - 1]
